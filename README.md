## Hello there!
I am Hello, a scripter in Luau with 3+ years of experience. I am able to perform many tasks for you, whether it be front-end or back-end, and I enjoy both equally. I use plenty of OOP in my works, and I am committed to helping you in whatever you need.

## Skills
**I am proficient in many areas, such as:**
* Datastores
* Handling purchases
* Inventory system
* UI scripting
* Tower defense system
* Lobby and teleport systems
* Pet systems
* Round systems
* and more

**I haven't had much experience with these yet, I will be doing these once I learn more about them, but for now, it depends on the situation.**
* Combat systems
* Simulators
* Tycoons
* Skillsets
* NPC Pathfinding

**Please do not ask me to do the following things:**
* Vehicle systems

## Availability

I am active during weekends and holidays, so 
During weeekdays, I am usually active within the late afternoon

## Commissions
I haven't made many commissions yet, but here is some of the work I have produced as a scripter:

### Creature Collection Game
I have been a scripter inside of Radaction studios, where I scripted a creature collection game (which is basically just a pokemon clone game). The game I've linked here is only a testing ground, so the UI and parts are merely placeholders.

### Lua Compiler
I have also created a Lua compiler, which would allow mobile players to get a taste of scripting in Roblox.

## Prices

The minimum amount I charge for commissions is R$ 1,000.
I currently accept Robux for now. If you are paying me via gamepass, I only take **tax-included** (R$ 1,300).

**If you want to know more info about my skills as a scripter, I'd be more than happy to answer. :)**
